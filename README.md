# Go Coding Problems

This repository is dedicated to solving coding problems using the Go programming language. It aims to provide efficient and readable solutions while exploring the diverse features and capabilities of Go.

## Repository Structure

Each coding problem has its own dedicated folder containing three main files:

- `solution.go`: The Go file containing the solution.
- `solution_test.go`: The Go file containing tests to verify the solution.
- `explanation.md`: A markdown file explaining the thought process and approach taken to solve the problem.
