# LeetCode Problem 238. Product of Array Except Self

[Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)

## Thought Process to Solve the Problem

The code is a Go function that solves the problem of computing the product of all elements in an input array except for the element at the current index. The function takes an integer slice called `nums` as input and returns an integer slice called `res` as output.

The function first creates an integer slice called `res` with the same length as the input slice `nums`. This slice will store the result of the computation.

The function then initializes a variable called `prefix` to 1 and iterates over the elements in the input slice `nums` using a `for` loop. For each element, the function sets the corresponding element in the `res` slice to the current value of `prefix` and updates the value of `prefix` by multiplying it with the current element in `nums`. This loop computes the product of all elements to the left of the current element.

The function then initializes a variable called `postfix` to 1 and iterates over the elements in the input slice `nums` in reverse order using another `for` loop. For each element, the function updates the corresponding element in the `res` slice by multiplying it with the current value of `postfix` and updates the value of `postfix` by multiplying it with the current element in `nums`. This loop computes the product of all elements to the right of the current element.

Finally, the function returns the `res` slice, which contains the product of all elements in the input slice except for the element at the current index.



## Time Complexity


Overall, this function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input slice `nums`. This is because we iterate over the input slice twice, performing constant time operations (multiplication and array access) for each element. Therefore, the time taken to solve the problem is proportional to the size of the input slice.
